# Moinboards Kastenwagen Alu PCB

![Kastenwagen Alu KLE](https://github.com/Technofrikus/moin-kastenwagen/raw/refs/heads/main/kastenwagen_alu_KLE.png)

Kastenwagen Alu is based on the [Kastenwagen 1840 by NoPunin10did](https://github.com/nopunin10did/kastenwagen/tree/main). It is a 40% keyboard with a mini-numpad and dedicated arrows. The main alpha block is 13.75u long, allowing for more dedicated punctuation keys (or non-English letters) to be paired with common Minivan-like mod keys.

- Keyboard Maintainer: [Technofrikus](https://github.com/Technofrikus) from [Moinboards](https://moinboards.de)
- Onboard STM32 MCU
- Based on the original PCB by NoPunin10did, but basically completely new and NOT compatible with the previous (printed) Kastenwagen case or PCB.
- Works with VIAL
