Kastenwagen 1840 is a 40% keyboard with a mini-numpad and dedicated arrows.  The main alpha block is 13.75u long, allowing for more dedicated punctuation keys (or non-English letters) to be paired with common Minivan-like mod keys.

Kastenwagen 48 is a similar keyboard that replaces the mini-numpad with a small macro column.
